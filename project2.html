      <div class="col-md-7">      	
		      <p class="c-para">This program is used to develop a better understanding of parsing and compiling by using Java. Since I have mainly used C/C++ as my main programming language, I will be getting familiar with the practical use of Java programming through this project. Furthermore, there are three ideas infused with this program which are syntactic analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation. </p>

      <div class="col-md-7">      	
		      <p class="c-para">I developed this program independently with the help of in class concepts. In the beginning of the project, the students were given a BNF and grammatical structure of E programming to understand to parse and translate the code to Java. From there, we start off with creating a scanner so that we can break up the input into tokens. Next, we develop a parser to reorganize the grammar using syntax graphs. The next part is one of the hardest parts of the program which is to create the symbol table. Without understanding how E programming stores variables and how to store the variables, it's difficult to proceed through the code. I approached the problem by using stacks and pushing variables through each scope appropriately by following the guideline of how E programming works. The last part is generating the code so that the translator creates a equivalent Java code that works the same as its E code counterpart. Of course, if there were any errors with scanning or parsing, error messages are outputed appropriately like any compiler would.

  				<p class="t-paraR"> Given the BNF of E programming, at the least the most simpliest parts such as loops, if statements, assignment variables, and print statements. By using the grammar in hand, change it into syntax graphs before translating it all into a parser. If there are any syntactically illegal E programs, the parser will output a error message as needed. </p>

  				<p class="t-paraR"> The toughest part of the program is enforcing the semantic contraints for the variables. Since variables are called at different scopes, we have to push the variables in and out as needed. Data structures such as Arraylist or stack both work for the purpose required here. If there are variables out of scope or redeclared, an appropriate error message outputs and the program is forced to stop. </p>

          <p class="t-paraR"> Having finished the main parts of the code, the last part is to edit the parser so that the equivalent Java code is outputted. Since the scanner doesn't scan the whitespaces and comments, the Java code isn't neatly orgarnized like the inputted E code. However, the execution of the two codes output the same values.</p>
