		      This program helps test all the knowledge I gained from Python in terms of understanding concepts and applying my problem-solving skills. Although this program appears simple, it deals with a deep understanding and usage of Python's progamming, allowing me to test my skills after only a quarter of learning about programming. <!-- Put short description here --> </p>

		      This simple mathematical program follows the rules of Conrad's Game of Life, giving us a complex behavior with some simple rules. Given the option to team up with someone, I decided to challenge myself to see how far my abilities went. This program was split into two parts. In order to get familiarized with the rules of the game of life, I started out by creating a program that printed the next generation of glider. Changing the list of 0's and 1's according to the rules of the Game of Life, the function would print out the next pattern of glider. 
		      Afterwards, I adapted the program so that it would read in user input for different pattern text files, how many generations, and if the outputted generations need to be saved to a file. To change the design a bit, I changed 0's into dots and 1's into asterisks. Instead of printing the next generation by calling the function one by one, the program would print them out consecutively. </p> <!-- Put short description here -->

  				<p class="t-paraR">After deciding on spliting the program into two parts, I first created a function called nextGen(glider) to get the next pattern based on the rules of Conway's Game of Life. In the beginning of the program, I declared a glider matrix with rows of 0's and 1's so that I could test that I would get the correct next pattern which is called the next generation. </p>

  			<div class="col-lg-1 right3">
  				<p class="t-paraR">Within the function, I created a deep copy of the glider and put that into a new list so that I could change the new list without affecting the original glider. I followed the mathematical computations that make up the rules in order to get the next generation and return it at the end of the function. </p>

  				<p class="t-paraR">The next part connects the first part so that I could get the next generation of the glider without having to make my following function more complicated. This function is called life(), and it asks for user input on file name to retrieve data, how many generations to print, and if the user would like to keep the generations obtained into a file. Of course, there are error prompts so that the function doens't malfunction. </p>

  				<p class="t-paraR">With a matrix data file, I create a new matrix and strip the file of the data to put into the newly created matrix. I would have to loop and find the next generation of the matrix provided a total of the user's input number plus one because the first generation is zero, which is the original matrix. </p>

This way the matrix will continue to stay most recent. After calling nextGen(glider), I would call my print function display(new_matrix) so that each generation is outputted. </p>
